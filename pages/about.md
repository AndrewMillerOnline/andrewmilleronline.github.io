# **About Me**

Hi I'm Andrew. <br/>
For as long as I can remember, I've had a passion for software.  It's a little like magic: with the right combination of words, you can create something where once there was nothing.

I've also always had an entrepreneurial mindset, and the power that software has to unlock business potential is truly fascinating to me.

But more than anything, I like a challenge.  I love performing analysis: connecting disparate, latent sources of information to extract data and create actionable business intelligence.

It's at this intersection of technology, business, and analysis that I am building my career.
