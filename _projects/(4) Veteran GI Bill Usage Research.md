## Background

While enrolled at the University of Illinois, I took an individual studies economics course under the mentorship of Dr. Bryan Buckley.  I used the semester to research veterans, and how our collective use of educational benefits has been affected by changes in the GI Bill, as well as various state-level veterans educational benefits.

## Method

I gathered a large amount of public data from the Department of Veterans Affairs to build a balanced panel with 16 years of usage data across 50 states and Washington DC.  I used Stata to perform the analysis and graphing, and ultimately applied a fixed effects model.

## Findings

The first significant finding was an update from a 2010 study by Simon, Negrusa, and Warner who predicted that the Post-9/11 GI Bill would increase benefit usage by 20%.  My findings indicated an increase of 70%, which is explained, in part, by also including benefit usage by dependents in my analysis.

The second (and to me, more interesting) finding was that veterans are absolutely maximizers.  The addition of the Post-9/11 GI Bill gave many veterans an option: should they use the new Post-9/11 GI Bill, or should they use the older Montgomery GI Bill?  My analysis indicates that in states with their own veteran educational benefits (such as Illinois' Illinois Veterans Grant or Texas' Hazlewood Act), veterans are more likely to use the Montgomery GI Bill.  This is likely the result of "stacking" both benefits at once to extract the maximum monetary value from both programs.
