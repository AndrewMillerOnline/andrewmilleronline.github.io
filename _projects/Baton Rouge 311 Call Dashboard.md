## The Data

This dataset consists of 23 columns and 457K rows, and was obtained from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/311-citizen-requests-for-service).  It contains a record for every 311 request made by citizens of Baton Rouge, LA between 2016 and November 11, 2020.

## The Goal

For this viz, I wanted to make a simple, clean KPI dashboard: something that the person in charge of Baton Rouge's 311 program might look at to get quick insight into the various departments' performance.
