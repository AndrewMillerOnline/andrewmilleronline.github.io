Inherent in that definition is the assumption that the data is correct. In the real world, however, data can occasionally be wrong. Maybe your ETL script has a small bug. Maybe an upstream data source messed up. Maybe a DAG didn’t finish fully. There are tons of possible causes, all with the same end... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Case Against Monolithic Dataflows</title><link href="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/case-against-monolithic-dataflows/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Case Against Monolithic Dataflows" /><published>2022-04-01T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2023-04-01T09:30:44-05:00</updated> <id>https://andrewmiller.online/posts/case-against-monolithic-dataflows/</id> <content src="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/case-against-monolithic-dataflows/" /> <author> <name>Andrew Miller</name> </author> <category term="CRM Analytics / Tableau CRM / Einstein Analytics" /> <category term="Dataflows &amp; Recipes" /> <summary> Background My project at work this quarter has been tackling various aspects of technical debt in our TCRM environment. Under that banner, one specific initiative that I spearheaded was to break down our main dataflow into smaller pieces. There are many compelling reasons why I wanted to make that change, and I believe that those reasons may also translate to your use case, as well. What’s a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Dataflow Extractor</title><link href="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/dataflow-extractor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dataflow Extractor" /><published>2022-03-09T00:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-03-09T13:21:36-06:00</updated> <id>https://andrewmiller.online/posts/dataflow-extractor/</id> <content src="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/dataflow-extractor/" /> <author> <name>Andrew Miller</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <summary> About I created this simple web tool to assist in Tableau CRM/Einstein Analytics dataflow development. It allows users to view the datasets being registered within a given dataflow, and then isolate only the nodes required to output a selected dataset(s). The Use Case If you’re in an organization like mine, you’ve probably seen some wicked large dataflows. We’re talking hundreds of nodes a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>SAQL Design Pattern: Reshaping Long to Wide (The Kansas City Shuffle)</title><link href="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/saql-design-pattern-reshaping-long-wide-kansas-city-shuffle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SAQL Design Pattern: Reshaping Long to Wide (The Kansas City Shuffle)" /><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2023-04-01T09:30:44-05:00</updated> <id>https://andrewmiller.online/posts/saql-design-pattern-reshaping-long-wide-kansas-city-shuffle/</id> <content src="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/saql-design-pattern-reshaping-long-wide-kansas-city-shuffle/" /> <author> <name>Andrew Miller</name> </author> <category term="CRM Analytics / Tableau CRM / Einstein Analytics" /> <category term="SAQL" /> <summary> Background When building dashboards, I frequently find myself needing to reshape data. Maybe it’s in a long format, but visually would make more sense as a wide table. Maybe it’s the other way around. In fact, I come across this situation so often that I’ve devised design patterns around each scenario. Today I’ll talk about how to transform from long to wide, a transformation that I’ve nick... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Marathon Viz</title><link href="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/marathon-viz/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Marathon Viz" /><published>2021-07-01T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-07-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://andrewmiller.online/posts/marathon-viz/</id> <content src="https://andrewmiller.online/posts/marathon-viz/" /> <author> <name>Andrew Miller</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <summary> Project Description For the final project in my data visualization course as part of the MS Data Science program at DePaul, I had to create complex visualizations from the dataset of my choice. As an avid runner, naturally I wanted to visualize something running related. Unable to find a suitable dataset, I instead created my own using Python to scrape over 2 million marathon finisher result... </summary> </entry> </feed>
