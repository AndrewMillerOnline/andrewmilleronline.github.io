# The Data

I gathered the data from a [PDF file](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/Drug%20Overdose%20Deaths%20-%20August%202019.pdf) published by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

## The Insight

One of the weird things about living in Illinois is that you have Chicago, and then you have everywhere else ("downstate").  They are like distinct entities, each with their own needs, trends, political leanings, etc.  Because Chicago has such a large population (roughly 75% of Illinoisans live in the Chicago metro area), it can often be easy to forget about the downstaters - or so those living downstate tend to feel.  Anyways, this also means that Chicago's data often dwarf the rest of the state.  Hence when we analyze total overdose deaths in Illinois between 2013 and 2018, we unsurprisingly see that Chicago's Cook County not only has the most overdoses, but has enough to drown out the rest of the state.

However, when we analyze the number of overdoses in a given county per 100K population, we can see that drug overdoses are not just a Chicago problem.  In fact, 15 Illinois counties - not one of which rhymes with 'hook' - exceed the national average overdose rate.  Granted, some of these counties have such a small population that a single overdose will cause it to exceed the 20.7 per 100k figure.
